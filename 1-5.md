### PlainText
```pyt!
"You must wonder why we have summoned you, AGENT? It has come to our attention that something terrible is about to take place. There is still time to prevent the disaster, and we could not think of anyone more suited for this task than you. We believe that if you can’t solve this quest, neither can anybody else. You have to travel to Vienna, and investigate a suspicious chemical plant. This mission must be executed in secrecy. It’s classified, and it regards the safety of the whole world, therefore we can’t tell you anything more just yet. Go now, you have the fate of the world in your hands."

Challenge: CCTV (rev)
You arrive at your destination. The weather isn't great, so you figure there's no reason to stay outside and you make your way to one of the buildings. No one bothered you so far, so you decide to play it bold - you make yourself a cup of coffee in the social area like you totally belong here and proceed to find an empty room with a desk and a chair. You pull out our laptop, hook it up to the ethernet socket in the wall, and quickly find an internal CCTV panel - that's a way better way to look around unnoticed. Only problem is... it wants a password.
```

### Solution by steps
1. Press the link it gave and you might get here
![](https://i.imgur.com/uSp8bKG.png)
2. After pressing `F12` to enter the DevTool, there's a script that shows this
```javascript=
...
<script>
const checkPassword = () => {
  const v = document.getElementById("password").value;
  const p = Array.from(v).map(a => 0xCafe + a.charCodeAt(0));

  if(p[0] === 52037 &&
     p[6] === 52081 &&
     p[5] === 52063 &&
     p[1] === 52077 &&
     p[9] === 52077 &&
     p[10] === 52080 &&
     p[4] === 52046 &&
     p[3] === 52066 &&
     p[8] === 52085 &&
     p[7] === 52081 &&
     p[2] === 52077 &&
     p[11] === 52066) {
    window.location.replace(v + ".html");
  } else {
    alert("Wrong password!");
  }
}

window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  document.getElementById("go").addEventListener("click", checkPassword);
  document.getElementById("password").addEventListener("keydown", e => {
    if (e.keyCode === 13) {
      checkPassword();
    }
  });
}, false);
</script>
...
```

3. It said that every character in password string will be transfer into ASCII code and add the ASCII value of `0xcafe`.
The result should be as same as the if-statement to pass this challenge.
4. Then execute this python code to get the answer:
```python=
p = {
    0: 52037,
    6: 52081,
    5: 52063,
    1: 52077,
    9: 52077,
    10: 52080,
    4: 52046,
    3: 52066,
    8: 52085,
    7: 52081,
    2: 52077,
    11: 52066,
}


for i in range(len(p)):
	print(chr(p[i] - 0xCafe), end="") # GoodPassword
```
5. Use the password you just got to find the flag

## Second Level

### Screen Shots

### PlainText

```!
It’s a cold day, and the snow is falling horizontally. It pierces your sight. You better use those extra pairs of socks that you were strangely given by the driver. Someone is waving on the other side of the street. You walk over to her. "Hi AGENT, I’m AGENT X, we’ve found the apartment of a person that we suspect got something to do with the mission. Come along!."

Challenge: Logic Lock (misc)
It turned out suspect's appartment has an electronic lock. After analyzing the PCB and looking up the chips you come to the conclusion that it's just a set of logic gates!
```


### Solution by steps
1. Hit the `Download` button, you might see this in the zipped file:

2. By knowing the truth table of simple logic gates, you could get this picture

## Third Level
### ScreenShots

### PlainText
```!
The person drives into a narrow back alley and despite the danger you try to continue on and give chase. It is impossible to see who they are, clothed all in black and a helmet covering the face. You need to intercept them somehow.

Challenge: High Speed Chase (misc)
You chase them through city streets until you reach the high way. The traffic is pretty rough for a car and you see them gaining ground - should have hotwired a motorbike as well! Too late for that. You look around your car to spot anything useful, and you notice this is actually one of the new self driving cars. You turn on the autopilot, pull out your laptop, connect it to the system, and enter the not-so-hidden developer's mode. It's time to re-program the autopilot to be a bit more useful in a chase! To make it easier, you replace the in-car LiDAR feed with a feed from an overhead sattelite - you also display it on the the entertainment system. Now all that's left to do, is to write a better controlCar function!
```

### Solution by steps
1. Press the link and you might be redirect to this page
![](https://i.imgur.com/xeOzv7e.png)
2. It's a webpage so turn on DevTool by pressing `F12` but found this
    ```!
    <!-- 
    Note that this is a PROGRAMMING challenge, not a reverse-engineering one. It's way easier to solve it in the intended way (by writing the code). That said, I'm a sign, not a cop.

    BTW, car sprites are by looneybits on CC0 (found on opengameart.org).
    -->
    ```

3. Look at the description on the right
    ```
    Car Self-Driving Interface

    You need to re-implement the controlCar function.

    To implement it in JavaScript use the editor on the left.
    
    When implemented, controlCar function will be called several times per second during the chase to allow for course corrections.

    The controlCar function takes a single parameter – scanArray – which is an array containing 17 integers denoting distance from your car to the nearest obstacle:

    [indexes 0-7]: on the left side of the car (index 7 is the measurement at the left headlight),
    [index 8]: at the center of the car,
    [indexes 9-16]: on the right side of the car (index 9 is the measurement at the right headlight).
    See also this image (it's not precise, but will give you an idea what you are looking at).

    All measurements are parallel to each other.

    A negative measurement might appear if the obstacle is very close behind our car.

    The controlCar must return an integer denoting where the car should drive:

    -1 (or any other negative value): drive more to the left,
    0: continue straight / straighten up the car,
    1 (or any other positive value): drive more to the right.
    ```
![](https://i.imgur.com/4ANFaUp.png)

4. Type in `console.log(scanArray)` many times and you might get this
![](https://i.imgur.com/duxxSGj.png)

    - Which means the three same value index might means a car there...
    And the value might be the distance of the cars in front of us.


5. Try `return` some numbers back and find this rule

    | return 1 | return 0     | return -1 |
    | -------- | ------------ | --------- |
    | down     | stay still   | up        |
6. By knowing that three lines with same index is a car, distance of the cars, and how to move our car, we could come up this code:

```javascript=
var maxTotal = 0; 
var currentIndex = 8; 

for (var i = 0; i < scanArray.length-3; i++) {
  // Multiply distances together to get the largest one
  var total = scanArray.slice(i, i+3).reduce((total, current) => total * current);

  // Save if there's one larger distance
  if (total > maxTotal) {
    maxTotal = total;
    currentIndex = i+Math.floor(3/2);  // reset the current index
  }
}

if (currentIndex < 8) {
  return -1;  // up
} else if (currentIndex > 8) {
  return 1;  // down
} else {
  return 0;  // stay still
}
```

7. Wait a moment and get this

"Welcome back AGENT. It seems like you've got a marvelous lead that perhaps gives a clue about where you should head to next. Visit the lab, and talk to that Dr. Klostermann, or is it Cloysterman?, he will know how to decrypt the device.. you would think". ... Dr Klostermann: "Welcome to the technical department AGENT, I’m Dr. Klostermann, and this is my assistant, Konstantin. Let’s not waste any time, is that the device that you’re holding in your hand? Konstantin, start the basic procedure."

Challenge: Electronics Research Lab (hw)
Welcome back AGENT. It seems like you got a lead that perhaps gives a clue about where the next journey on your quest goes. Visit the lab, and talk to Dr. Klostermann, he will know how to decrypt the device Note: If you solved the challenge before but could not submit the flag, please try again, we had the wrong flag in our database.

## Fifth Level
![](https://i.imgur.com/Dvy5InI.png)

### PlainText
```!
It’s a hot day, and your skin is cracking and dry. It’s difficult to make your way through the crowded bazaar. A high pitch voice pierces through the soundscape from a salesman that’s trying to sell colorful fabrics and then from another corner comes delicious smells. You spot a hand waving - it’s your contact that you’ve been waiting to meet. "Take a seat, my friend, I’m Gökhan, have you been to Istanbul before? No, really? I’m sure that you will have a great time, I’ve ordered tea for the two of us. Show me the amulet, will you?. Wow, this is really something from my younger days, this is as mysterious as it is beautiful and belongs to “The cloaked brotherhood”. They are very dangerous, and eventhough your quest is urgent, I would advise you to not continue looking for the owner of this. Go home, and forget about it." In the blink of an eye, four tough guys show up, and you start to run together with Gökhan through the crowded marketplace and then up on a rooftop. The tough guys are closing in, but the two of you climb down from the rooftop, run around a corner and are able to hide in two crates.

Challenge: Twisted robot (misc)
We found this old robo caller. It basically generates random phone numbers to spam. We found the last list of numbers in generated and also some weird file... Maybe it's got to do with these new beta features they were testing?
```

### Solution by steps
1. Download the file and open the python file
```python=
import random

# Gots to get that formatting right when send it to our call center
def formatNumber(n):
    n = str(n)
    return f'{n[:3]}-{n[3:6]}-{n[6:]}'

# This generates random phone numbers because it's easy to find a lot of people!
# Our number generator is not great so we had to hack it a bit to make sure we can
# reach folks in Philly (area code 215)
def generateRandomNumbers():
    arr = []
    for i in range(624):
        arr.append(formatNumber(random.getrandbits(32) + (1<<31)))
    return arr

def encodeSecret(s):
    key = [random.getrandbits(8) for i in range(len(s))]
    return bytes([a^b for a,b in zip(key,list(s.encode()))])


def menu():
    print("""\n\nWelcome to the RoboCaller!! What would you like to do?
1: generate a new list of numbers
2: encrypt a super secret (in beta)
3: decrypt a super secret (coming soon!!)
4: exit""")
    choice = ''
    while choice not in ['1','2','3']:
        choice = input('>')
        if choice == '1':
            open('robo_numbers_list.txt','w').write('\n'.join(generateRandomNumbers()))
            print("...done! list saved under 'robo_numbers_list.txt'")
        elif choice == '2':
            secret = input('give me your secret and I\'ll save it as "secret.enc"')
            open('secret.enc','wb').write(encodeSecret(secret))
        elif choice == '3':
            print("stay tuned for this awesome feature\n\n")
        elif choice == '4':
            print("Thank you for using RoboCaller1337!")
    return

def main():
    while True:
        menu()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```
2. While notice that there's a random key, we should predict the pseudorandom numbers by importing `randcrack`
```python=
from randcrack import RandCrack

rc = RandCrack()

# Decode phone number
def decode_random_number(number):
    return int(number.replace("-", "")) - (1<<31)

# Decrypt secret
def decode_secret(s):
    # Predict random key using RandCrack
    key = [rc.predict_getrandbits(8) for i in range(len(s))]

    # XOR key and secret
    return bytes(a^b for a,b in zip(s,key)).decode('utf-8')

# Read all lines from robo_numbers_list.txt
with open("robo_numbers_list.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        # Decode phone number and submit it to RandCrack
        rc.submit(decode_random_number(line.strip()))

# Decrypt the secret by predicting the random values used
with open("secret.enc", "rb") as f:
    print(decode_secret(f.read()))

```
3. Run this code in the same level of the other files and you might recieved the flag: `CTF{n3v3r_3ver_ev3r_use_r4nd0m}`

```!
You’re exiting a crowded subway nearby the office that you are about to visit. You are showing the guards your ID and answering a couple of routine questions. They are not impressed, but the gate opens up and you can enter the area despite their doubt. You are not allowed to stroll freely on the company grounds, but are shown around by a woman that stares at you with a crooked smile. At last you're able to talk to the manager, a short man with a white robe and shades: "Greetings, AGENT, You must be thirsty after your long journey? No? You don’t mind if I’ll have something for myself, do you? Good! We have heard about the device that you possess, can I have a look at it. Hmm, it seems that it is encrypted. Help me break this quickly so that we can continue with the analysis."

Challenge: To the moon (misc)
This one is a doozie. We found this weird file on a memory stick with a post-it note on it. It looks like someone was working on a very obscure encryption system. Maybe we can decode it?
